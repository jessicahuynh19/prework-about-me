      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>When I'm not studying, I'm a Starbucks Barista. This is also the third time I've changed my "major". I was originally a Chemistry major and did that for two years at Whitworth University in Spokane. After two years I switched to Marketing Management and took courses online, and now I've here learning web development</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Kirkland, Washington. My ethnicity is Vietnamese, but I was born and raised here.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm more on the extrovert side, so I prefer to go out rather then stay at home. When I'm not out with friends, I can spend endless amounts of hours watching Youtube videos.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My ultimate dream job would to be to get paid to travel. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been a user for so long, that now I want to be the creator/developer. I believe the best way to keep up with this modern age is to learned how it's being put together.</p>
